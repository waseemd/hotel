This is a basic reservations system using PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

I have used a sort of MVC architecture, so that the elements are separated, i.e. the views, controllers and other types of files.

In terms of external libraries, I have used JQUERY, AJAX and a javascript datetimepicker. I have also downloaded images from the internet to mockup rooms.
