This is a basic reservations system using PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

I have used a sort of MVC architecture, so that the elements are separated, i.e. the views, controllers and other types of files. There are no models or classes as the site itself is too simplistic for that implementation.

In terms of external libraries, I have used JQUERY, AJAX and a javascript datetimepicker. I have also downloaded images from the internet to mockup rooms.
